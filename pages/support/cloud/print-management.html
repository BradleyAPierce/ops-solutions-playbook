                  Multi-Technology Card Reader takes user authentications to a
                  higher level of security and convenience.

                  in print/scan performance and no loss of the security
                  safeguards you count on to protect sensitive data. And it even
                  adds support for HID Mobile Access from your iPhone or Android
