                      <strong>Location-Aware Printing</strong>: The new

                      location and removes them when they leave. This feature
                      enhances productivity by allowing users to print
                      immediately without needing IT support.

                      allows users to access printers without installing devices
                      or drivers. Available printers are automatically
                      displayed, and those no longer available are removed,
                      reducing post-installation support calls and accommodating
                      the hybrid and mobile workforce.

                    Konica Minolta's Dispatcher Phoenix is a powerful
                    application that can help any business save time by
                    automating document image processing, printing, and routing
                    tasks via customizable workflows. With a large variety of
                    processing features, virtually everything is possible – from
                    extracting data from documents, converting files to PDF or
                    Office formats, applying annotations, and renaming files to
                    routing documents to folders, FTP servers, MFPs, or e-mail
                    recipients – and it's all fully automatic! Unique LiveFlo
                    technology provides a real-time view of documents as they
                    are being processed – a great way to identifying bottlenecks
                    and making sure files will reach their correct destinations.

                  <p>
                    Dispatcher Phoenix provides busy offices with the
                    convenience and flexibility they need. The application is
                    highly scalable up to the largest enterprise environments.
                    Dispatcher Phoenix includes a web user interface for access
                    to important enterprise tools – such as apps for setting up
                    server clusters for redundancy/load balancing, failover,
                    offloading, sharing workflows with specific users, and more.
                    Administrators can manage their workflows (run, stop, pause)
                    from the web as well as edit user variables and view
                    important analytics about work being done, including the
                    number of documents being scanned, files collected, and
                    users scanning.
