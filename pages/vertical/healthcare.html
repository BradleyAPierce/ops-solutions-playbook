                      Print Secure Prescriptions. Consistent with tamper
                      resistant security regulations mandated by the Center for
                      Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Rx Shield process
                      applies anti-copy, anti-erasure and pharmacy alerts to
                      prescriptions printed on plain paper, eliminating the need
                      for costly pre-printed prescription forms.

                      Integrated EHR Scanning (HL7 &amp; CDA
                      Compatible).&nbsp;With Dispatcher Phoenix's HL7
                      Connectivity, staff can securely scan patient information
                      from a Konica Minolta MFP and easily attach that
                      information to the patient record in an EHR. In addition,
                      with Dispatcher Phoenix's CDA Generator, healthcare
                      professionals can automatically process medical documents
                      and patient data into standard HL7 CDA documents, allowing
                      the documents to be communicated between major medical
                      providers and systems. Using Dispatcher Phoenix's
                      intuitive interface at the MFP, staff can easily look up
                      patient data, input additional information such as patient
                      name and medical record number, choose the appropriate
                      document type, and send as an HL7 message to your
                      patient's EHR.

                      means of sharing health information, the persistent use of
                      physical fax machines poses serious risks to privacy and
                      security. Data security concerns have fueled a growing
                      trend toward adopting cloud-based services in the

                      efficiency, and cost reduction. By replacing traditional
                      with cloud fax, the healthcare industry can mitigate risks

                    Sharing information between providers, patients, and health
                    plans has never been more important — or more challenging.
                    Despite the implementation of electronic health records,
                    paper continues to play a role in many clinical and
                    administrative processes. Further, scanning documents to a
                    patient's health record can be a complicated and disjointed
                    process, requiring multiple steps with manual, error-prone
                    processes, consuming administrative staff time. Sharing
                    those documents is largely dependent on legacy fax machines,
                    which pose potential security risks.

                    The Konica Minolta Healthcare-Enabled MFP Plus, driven by
                    the bizhub One i-Series intuitive interface with Kno2
                    Connected™ integration, enables healthcare providers to
                    quickly and securely capture, store, and share patient
                    information across the care continuum. With the Healthcare
                    MFP, customers are able to enhance care coordination, reduce
                    costs, maximize staff productivity, and most importantly,
