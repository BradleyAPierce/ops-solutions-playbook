                    <strong>Security Features of the Hosted Solution:</strong
                    ><br />
                    • Security starts with clustered firewalls to help filter
                    out unwanted traffic<br />
                    • Network monitoring watches for anything odd and alerts
                    hosting administrators<br />
                    • All data sent to and from servers are sent via an
                    encrypted 256-bit SSL (TLS 1.2) channel<br />
                    • Servers are scanned and locked down according to PCI DSS
                    3.1<br />
                    • Data communication between internal web service and
                    database servers are encrypted via a separate 256-bit SSL
                    (TLS 1.2) channel<br />
                    • Database data is encrypted at rest, meaning your data is
                    always protected<br />
                    • All TLS certificates are constantly, and automatically,
                    kept up to date to make sure communications are always using
                    the latest encryption<br />
                    • Third party environmental and security monitoring<br />
                    • Each customer has their own database and web services, and
                    are secured with their own authentication<br />
                    • Multiple fields are required for authentication to our
                    Hosted service and are unique to each customer<br />
                    • For any transfer of bulk data between School Gate Guardian
                    (or your SIS), SGG implements SFTP to keep the file
                    transfers secure, with API integration occurring for some
                    SIS sytems

                  <p>
                    The School Gate Guardian hosting facility performs daily
                    backups with copies stored off site, maintains multiple Tier
                    1 internet connections, independent cooling, direct grid
                    power with UPS and automatic generator fail-over. All
                    services are on a highly available service to automatically
                    fail-over to other hardware in case of an issue.

                    School Gate Guardian also offers the Classroom Guardian, a
                    physical door barrier that prevents unwanted entry for
                    classrooms. In emergency lock down situations, the Classroom
                    Guardian locks into place in a matter of seconds. It comes
                    with a proprietary tool to disengage from the hallway if
                    needed.

                    The Uniprint Solution Suite is primarily used in the
                    Education market to track, control, charge for and report on
                    network printing, copying, and scanning. The Pharos iMFP
                    connector enables access to applications for print
                    management, cost control and networking directly from the
                    bizhub MFP control panel. The Secure Release Here®
                    application protects documents by holding print jobs in a
                    secure network queue until the user is at the device and
                    provides authentication.
                  </p>

                    Uniprint also has direct real-time links to campus
                    accounting systems such as Blackboard®, CBORD® and Heartland
                    Payment Systems Campus Solutions. For those locations that
                    incorporate Magnetic Stripe, HID Proximity or HID iClass
                    cards for student ID, building or dorm access and campus
                    purchases, the AU-205H or the AU-204H fully integrate to
                    allow for seamless authentication and cost accounting.
