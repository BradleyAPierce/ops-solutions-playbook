                  Compliance issues have become more complex, security demands
                  are continually increasing, environmental sustainability
                  concerns are now paramount and, IT infrastructure needs are
                  always evolving. As such, security and compliance measures
                  account for a growing portion of their IT budget. Law firms
                  have become a treasure trove for hackers because they are the
                  least guarded path to their clients' confidential data. They
                  must deploy policies and advanced legal records management
                  measures that identify and mitigate risks, and prove that
                  their clients' assets are secure. Konica Minolta can help with
                  our MFPs which are ISO 15408 certified at EAL 3, the highest

                  services, including ethical hacking, penetration tests,
                  vulnerability assessments, and cybersecurity planning.
