                    Dispatcher Stratus is a cloud workflow solution that is
                    designed to streamline and consolidate your organization’s
                    processes by incorporating People-Based Workflows<br />
                    into Intelligent Document Processing (IDP). That means the
                    processes that can be automated are automated, and the
                    processes that require a human touch are simple to
                    accomplish. Using Dispatcher Stratus, customers can manage
                    their workflows, users, devices, forms, authentication, and
                    more from a single location that is accessible from
                    anywhere. Dispatcher Stratus is designed to match an
                    organization’s needs exactly. Easily add, group, and remove
                    employees, devices, workflows, and forms as needs change.

                  <p>
                    <strong>Boost Productivity:</strong><br />
                    Dispatcher Stratus allows organizations to send jobs to
                    individuals, groups, or queues, ensuring that every job is
                    made available to the right employee. The Jobs interface
                    provides vital information, including areas for document
                    previews, notes, job history, and more.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Maximize Existing Resources</strong><br />
                    Dispatcher Stratus takes advantage of your existing hardware
                    and connects to the software and cloud storage solutions
                    you’re already using. Most importantly, it frees your
                    employees from time-consuming manual tasks and lets them
                    focus on growing your business.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Automation at your Fingertips</strong><br />
                    Dispatcher Stratus offers many advanced processing
                    capabilities to ensure your documents are renamed,
                    annotated, modified, and converted the way your organization
                    needs. Additional features include connections to
                    ODBC-compliant databases, metadata manipulation with LUA
                    scripting, and more.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <strong>Web Forms Process Management</strong><br />
                    Dispatcher Stratus supports custom form creation and
                    management, meaning that your workflows are even more
                    accessible than ever before. Documents and data can be
                    captured from native form submissions that minimize
                    dependencies on inefficient paper forms and PDFs. Forms can
                    be branded or embedded within your existing website and can
                    be tracked and interacted with from the Dispatcher Stratus
                    portal.
