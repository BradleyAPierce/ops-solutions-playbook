                      >Konica Minolta's Dispatcher Phoenix is a powerful
                      application that can help any business save time by
                      automating document image processing, printing, and
                      routing tasks via customizable workflows. With a large
                      variety of processing features, virtually everything is
                      possible – from extracting data from documents, converting
                      files to PDF or Office formats, applying annotations, and
                      renaming files to routing documents to folders, FTP
                      servers, MFPs, or e-mail recipients – and it's all fully
                      automatic! Unique LiveFlo technology provides a real-time
                      view of documents as they are being processed – a great
                      way to identify bottlenecks and make sure files will reach
                      their correct destinations.</span

                      convenience and flexibility they need. The application is
                      highly scalable to the largest enterprise environment.
                      Dispatcher Phoenix includes a web user interface for
                      access to important enterprise tools – such as apps for
                      setting up server clusters for redundancy/load balancing,
                      failover, offloading, sharing workflows with specific
                      users, and more. Administrators can manage their workflows
                      (run, stop, pause) from the web as well as edit user
                      variables and view important analytics about work being
                      done, including the number of documents being scanned,

                        folder to store your documents in, use a search field
                        with type-ahead functionality to quickly filter the list
                        of folders displayed and even create a new folder to
                        scan into – using a visually enhanced display at the
                        MFP. Utilizing OCR, customers can extract data from

                        text file, convert documents to searchable PDFs, and
                        more. Documents are then instantly routed to the defined
                        delivery location so files are available when and where
                        you need them – every time. Dispatcher Phoenix ScanTrip
