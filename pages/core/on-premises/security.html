                    How can you make certain your valuable data is SAFE from
                    THEFT – and prevent it from being stolen from your MFP or
                    extracted if the hard disk drive is removed from your
                    device? The answer is simple – and all it takes is allowing
                    an authorized Konica Minolta Field Engineer to activate the
                    bizhub security features on your bizhub MFP. With bizhub
                    Secure safeguards in place, you will know that your
                    documents have uncompromising security protectio<img

                    The bizhub SECURE Platinum Service was developed to provide
                    resources needed to lock down and protect any document data
                    that might reside on the bizhub's internal hard drive. To
                    secure and protect any document image data that might be
                    present on the hard drive, the following security functions
                    can be enabled:
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    • Hard Drive Encryption*<br />
                    • Hard Drive Lock Password<br />
                    • Automatic deletion of any temporary image data<br />
                    • Data overwrite of electronic documents on a timed basis<br />
                    Ultimately, protecting student information is everyone's
                    responsibility. Konica Minolta has led the industry in
                    providing enhanced security features for the digital era –
                    and with powerful bizhub SECURE Platinum functions activated
                    by the Konica Minolta Field Engineer, it provides an
                    additional line of defense against data theft and
                    unauthorized access to educational documents or devices.

                    How can healthcare providers protect patient
                    confidentiality? Are they encrypting medical records or
                    protecting files using passwords? Does access to their
                    printer/ copier require user authentication? Are they
                    tracking print/copy functions so they know who, when and
                    where copies were made? Is their email traffic logged and
                    preserved? Are printouts and faxes containing PHI protected
                    from unauthorized personnel? Have they extended their
                    network security protocol to their multifunction devices?
                    And are they confident that HIPAA compliance measures are in
                    place at every step of your medical workflow?
                  </p>

                    This is all covered with bizhub SECURE Healthcare. This
