                    other employees the ability to control confidential
                    information. With Release2Me, print jobs are held in a queue
                    until they are released at the MFP by an authenticated user.
                    This ensures that documents are not printed until users
                    enter a password or use an ID card to authenticate
                    themselves at the MFP, confirming that they are physically
                    present to pick up their printed documents. Since the print
                    jobs are held in the queue, not on the MFP's Hard Drive, the
                    user can print these documents from any networked device.
                    And unclaimed documents can be deleted from the queue after
                    a specific amount of time.
