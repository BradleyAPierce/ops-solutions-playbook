              <h2>Active Directory</h2>
              <p>
                Active Directory (AD) is a directory service created by
                Microsoft for Windows domain networks. Active Directory serves
                as a central location for network administration and security.
                It is responsible for authenticating and authorizing all users
                and computers within Windows domain type, assigning and
                enforcing security policies within all computers in a network
                and installing or updating network software on network
                computers.
              </p>
              <h2>Additive Primary Colors</h2>
              <p>
                The primary colors of light from which all other colors can be
                made – red, green and blue. Adding 100 percent of all three
                produces white light while adding lesser intensities produces a
                gamut of different colors. Combining 100 percent of two additive
                primaries produces a subtractive primary: red + green = yellow,
                red + blue = magenta, green + blue = cyan
              </p>
              <h2>AS/400</h2>
              <p>
                The IBM System i (formerly known as iSeries, AS/400 and
                Application System/400) is a minicomputer platform produced by
                IBM. It was officially introduced as the AS/400 in 1988. It was
                then renamed to the eServer iSeries in 2000 as part of IBM's
                e-Server branding initiative. In 2006, the platform has once
                again been renamed to System i.
              </p>
              <h2>ASCII</h2>
              <p>
                American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII),
                generally pronounced "askee", is a character encoding based on
                the English alphabet. ASCII codes represent text in computers,
                communications equipment, and other devices that work with text.
              </p>
              <h2>Bates Numbering</h2>
              <p>
                Bates Numbering (aka Bates stamping) is used in the legal,
                medical and business fields to place identifying numbers and/or
                date/time-marks on images and documents as they are scanned or
                processed (for example, during the discovery stage of
                preparations for trial or identifying business receipts).
              </p>
              <h2>Bus and Tag</h2>
              <p>
                A common name for the parallel channel between IBM mainframes
                and peripherals. One set of cables carries the data (the bus)
                and another set is for control information (the tag).
              </p>
              <h2>BYOD (Bring Your Own Device)</h2>
              <p>
                An increasing trend allowing employees and other users to
                utilize a personal device within a business to execute
                enterprise applications and access data. Typically, it includes
                smartphones and tablets, but may also be used for PCs.
              </p>
              <h2>Calibration</h2>
              <p>
                The act of adjusting a device to bring its behavior in
                accordance with a known specification. For example, monitors are
                calibrated to a specific color temperature, gamma, and
                monochrome luminance. Imagesetters and plate setters are
                calibrated to make sure that they deliver the requested dot
                percentage accurately. Calibration is typically accomplished by
                measuring the behavior of a device with an instrument such as a
                colorimeter or densitometer, comparing the measured behavior
                with the standard to which the device is being calibrated and
                then adjusting the device so that it behaves in accordance with
                that standard.
              </p>
              <h2>CMY</h2>
              <p>
                Cyan, magenta and yellow are the subtractive primary colors or a
                color space that describes colors in terms of their cyan,
                magenta, and yellow components.
              </p>
              <h2>Color Management</h2>
              <p>
                A set of software technologies that seeks to match color across
                input, display and output devices by referencing the color
                behavior to a known standard by means of device profiles. The
                signals received by each device are adjusted in such a way that
                the perceived color remains consistent.
              </p>
              <h2>CSV (Comma-Separated Values)</h2>
              <p>
                Also known as a comma-separated list or comma-separated
                variables file format, this file type stores tabular data. The
                format dates back to the early days of business computing. For
                this reason, CSV files are common on all computer platforms.
              </p>
              <h2>Densitometer</h2>
              <p>An instrument that measures optical density.</p>
              <h2>DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)</h2>
              <p>
                A device can have a different IP address every time it connects
                to the network. The computer or device requests an address from
                a DHCP server as it is booting. The DHCP server acknowledges the
                request and offers an address. After the address is accepted,
                the DHCP server removes that address from its pool so it cannot
                be given out again.
              </p>
              <h2>Document Management</h2>
              <p>
                A document management system (DMS) is a computer system (or set
                of computer programs) used to track and store electronic
                documents and/or images of paper documents. It is usually also
                capable of keeping track of the different versions created by
                different users (history tracking).
              </p>
              <h2>FTP (File Transfer Protocol)</h2>
              <p>
                Used to transfer data from one computer to another over the
                Internet or through a network.
              </p>
              <h2>Fuzzy Search</h2>
              <p>
                Name for a category of techniques for finding strings that
                approximately match some given pattern string. It may also be
                known as approximate or inexact matching.
              </p>
              <h2>Gamut</h2>
              <p>
                The range of color a device can produce or the range of color a
                color model can represent.
              </p>
              <h2>Gradation</h2>
              <p>
                The process of making the tonal range of a basic colors increase
                in a linear fashion from lightest to darkest.
              </p>
              <h2>High Availability (HA)</h2>
              <p>
                Refers to a system component or solution that is continuously
                operational.
              </p>
              <h2>
                HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)
              </h2>
              <p>
                Enacted by the U.S. Congress in 1996. According to the Centers
                for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) website, Title I of
                HIPAA protects health insurance coverage for workers and their
                families when they change or lose their jobs. Essentially HIPAA
                ensures privacy standards across the health/insurance industry.
              </p>
              <h2>ICC Profile</h2>
              <p>
                A standard format developed by the ICC for a data file that
                describes the color behavior of an input, display or output
                device, or a color model, by referencing it to a
                device-independent color model such as CIE XYZ or CIELAB. Used
                in almost all current color-management systems.
              </p>
              <h2>Index Data / Metadata</h2>
              <p>
                Index data or Metadata are key bits of data pertaining to
                documents in a document management system that are used to
                identify the document for quick retrieval. The index data is
                entered along with a document into a document system. The data
                is generally stored into a high-performance database such as SQL
                (structured query language) database that can retrieve data in
                very short timeframes. Examples are Account Numbers, Invoice
                Numbers, Purchase Order Numbers or Serial Numbers.
              </p>
              <h2>Imposition</h2>
              <p>
                Term used in the printing industry. Print operators will print
                books using large sheets of paper which will be folded later.
                This allows for faster printing, simplified binding, and lower
                production costs. Imposition is the process of arranging pages
                correctly prior to printing so that they fold in the correct
                order. To someone unfamiliar with the imposition process, the
                pages may seem to be arranged randomly; but after printing the
                paper is folded, bound and trimmed. If correctly imposed, the
                pages should all appear in the correct orientation and readable
                sequence.
              </p>
              <h2>IPDS (Intelligent Printer Data Stream)</h2>
              <p>
                IBM's Systems Application Architecture host-to-printer data
                stream for Advanced Function Presentation subsystems. It
                provides an attachment-independent interface for controlling and
                managing all-points-addressable (APA) printers that allows the
                presentation of pages containing an architecturally unlimited
                mixture of different data types, including text, image,
                graphics, bar code, and object container. It is used by a
                variety of IBM and OEM print servers that drive
                all-points-addressable (APA) page printers. Generally, these
                printers are at the medium, to high-end of the print speed and
                volume spectrum.
              </p>
              <h2>LDAP</h2>
              <p>
                Lightweight Directory Access Protocol: A set of protocols for
                accessing information directories such as an email address book
                residing on an email server.
              </p>
              <h2>MDM (Mobile Device Management)</h2>
              <p>
                An industry term for security software that provides
                distribution, policy, inventory, security and services
                management for mobile devices deployed across an organization.
                MDM is commonly related to enterprise use of mobile devices,
                where it is important for businesses to both allow for effective
                mobile device use, and protect sensitive data from unauthorized
                access.
              </p>
              <h2>MIB (Management Information Base)</h2>
              <p>
                A database of objects that can be monitored by a network
                management system. PageScope Web Connection is an example of
                MIB.
              </p>
              <h2>MFP</h2>
              <p>Multi-function printer.</p>
              <h2>NIC (Network Interface Card)</h2>
              <p>
                A network card, network adapter, LAN Adapter or NIC (network
                interface card) is a piece of computer hardware designed to
                allow computers to communicate over a<br />
                computer network.
              </p>
              <h2>OCR (Optical Character Recognition)</h2>
              <p>
                Usually abbreviated to OCR, is the mechanical or electronic
                translation of images of typewritten or printed text (usually
                captured by a scanner) into machine-editable text. When the OCR
                process is invoked, the document image is converted into a
                format that allows the user to edit text instead of retyping the
                entire document.
              </p>
              <h2>PDF (Portable Document Format)</h2>
              <p>
                The file format created by Adobe Systems in 1993 for document
                exchange. This file format provides an electronic image of text
                and graphics that resembles the printed document. PDF files can
                be viewed, printed and transmitted electronically.
              </p>
              <h2>Peer-to-Peer Network</h2>
              <p>
                A peer-to-peer LAN is an easy-to-configure, simple-to-implement
                network model. Many homes and small businesses use a
                peer-to-peer network. Workstations are connected together
                through a hub or switch for resource sharing such as files,
                folders or printers. Peer-to-peer networks do have limitations.
                User account information must be managed at each workstation.
                There is no centralized storage of information for user account
                management. It's hard to locate files as they tend to be
                distributed among various workstations, and there are
                limitations to the number of concurrent connections to shared
                resources. But, in many instances, a peer-to-peer LAN is
                adequate and useful. No server required, which is sometimes a
                big cost saving, and no IT "expert" is needed.
              </p>
              <h2>Primary Colors</h2>
              <p>
                The colors from which all other colors can be made. The primary
                colors of light are red, green and blue. These are the additive
                primaries used for transmissive or emissive color. The primary
                colors of pigments are cyan, magenta and yellow and are used for
                reflective color. It's possible to create all colors from
                primary colors because the human eye contains three different
                types of color-sensitive photoreceptors which are sensitive to
                the individual primary colors.
              </p>
              <h2>Redaction</h2>
              <p>
                Edited, modified or revised document from which confidential or
                sensitive information has been removed.
              </p>
              <h2>Resolution</h2>
              <p>
                Resolution describes image clarity. It indicates the number of
                dots per inch. Raster graphics are resolution dependent. They
                cannot scale to an arbitrary resolution without loss of apparent
                quality. Modern computer monitors typically display about 72 to
                130 pixels per inch (PPI) and some modern consumer printers can
                resolve 2400 dots per inch (DPI) or more; determining the most
                appropriate image resolution for a given printer-resolution can
                pose difficulties since printed output may have a greater level
                of detail than a viewer can discern on a monitor. Typically, a
                resolution of 150 to 300 pixels per inch works well for 4-color
                process (CMYK) printing.
              </p>
              <h2>RFP (Request for Proposal)</h2>
              <p>
                An invitation for suppliers, through a bidding process, to
                submit a proposal on a specific commodity or service.
              </p>
              <h2>RFI (Request for Information)</h2>
              <p>
                A standard business process whose purpose is to collect written
                information about the capabilities of various suppliers.
                Normally it follows a format that can be used for comparative
                purposes.
              </p>
              <h2>RIP (Raster Image Processor)</h2>
              <p>
                A component used in a printing system which produces a bitmap.
                The bitmap is then sent to a printing device for output. The
                input may be in a high-level page description language such as
                PostScript, Portable Document Format, XPS or another bitmap of
                higher or lower resolution than the output device. In the latter
                case, the RIP applies either smoothing or interpolation

              <h2>Saturation</h2>
              <p>
                The property of a color that makes it appear as strongly
                colored. Black, white and gray have no saturation. A red tomato
                has high saturation. Pastel colors have low saturation also
                known as Chroma. This attribute of color is used in the HLS
                (Hue, Lightness, and Saturation) and HSB (Hue, Saturation and
                Brightness) color models.

              <h2>Spectrophotometer</h2>
              <p>
                An instrument that measures the amount of light a color sample
                reflects or transmits at each wavelength, producing spectral
                data.

              <p>
                Cyan, magenta, and yellow. Used to create reflective color. Cyan
                absorbs (subtracts) all red light, reflecting blue and green.
                Magenta absorbs all green light, reflecting blue and red. Yellow
                absorbs all blue light, reflecting red and green.

              <h2>VDP (Variable-Data Printing)</h2>
              <p>
                Also known as variable-information printing (VIP), VDP is a form
                of on-demand printing in which elements such as text, graphics,
                and images may be changed from one printed piece to the next
                without stopping or slowing down the printing process, using
                information from a database or external file.
